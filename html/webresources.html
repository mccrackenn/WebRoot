                <p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a><br />Codecademy- Codecademy has been and
                    continues to be a valuable learning tool in my progression towards
                    becoming a full-stack developer. I paid for a one year pro membership back in December and I have
                    not
                    regretted my choice. Codecademy’s learning model is multi-faceted. They give you written lessons,
                    followed by a simulator where you practice what you just learned. To further cement the lesson, one
                    completes projects after the lessons. These projects offer hints if you get stuck, along with an
                    option
                    to watch a
                    recorded video of a professional developer completing the project. <strong>Rating:</strong>5 out of

                <p><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm">Tutorialspoint</a><br />Tutorialspoint is a site I
                    often look to when I need more information on a topic. Their webpage structure is excellent. A menu
                    on
                    the left side of the page concisely structures the learning module, making it simple to narrow in on
                    what you want. For instance, just this morning I
                    was seeking help on Bootstrap. I was easily able to find the grid system information I was looking
                    for
                    because grid system was one of choices on the menu. Much like W3 schools, Tutorialspoint provides
                    detailed information on a subject and demonstrates it with snippets of code. A live demo option with
                    various device selectors gives you the ability to see the output on different sized screens.

                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/IAmTimCorey/videos">Tim Corey</a><br />I discovered Tim Corey’s
                    YouTube
                    channel while taking Prog123, Server Side Web Dev at Bellevue College. His videos have been
                    immensely
                    helpful, specifically those on MVC and read/writing to databases. I enjoy the way he breaks down and
                    explains complex ideas. If he has done a video previously on one of these complex ideas, he will
                    provide
                    a link and instruct his subscribers to check it out. He builds projects from ground up to
                    completion.
                    One can sit back and watch the whole tutorial or treat is as a ride-along. Building the project
                    along
                    with him. <strong>Rating:</strong>4.5 out of 5. </p>

                    go-to sources that is rich and diverse in subject matter. While they do have a tutorials section for
                    web technologies that includes; HTML, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript (listed in both Web Technologies &
                    Languages). I have found myself on the site more for their robust programming language examples e.g.
                    writing functions, OOP, than for support with HTML, CSS problems. For beginners to intermediate
                    programmers, Geeks does a fantastic job correlating clear examples from the standards, which are not
                    overly complicated.

                <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a><br /> Stack Overflow is a
                    resource that often either helps me or leads me further down the rabbit hole in my search. This is
                    because many
                    of the questions/solutions on Stack are above my level. Hopefully as I advance in my
                    education/career, I can grasp more from the site. Whenever I do a Google search for help with an
                    issue, Stack Overflow is usually the top result or one of the top five results. Due to the
                    complexity of many examples, I try to use the site as support if I cannot find an answer on my other
                    web resource sites.
